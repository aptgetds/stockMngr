C = Cost of Purchases
U = Total Units Held
ACB = Adjusted Cost Base = C/U

After a purchase of u units, costing $c (including commissions):
C(new) = C(old) + c     You've spent c more dollars
U(new) = U(old) + u     You have u additional units
ACB(new) = C(new)/U(new)

After a sale of u units
C(new) = C(old) - u ACB(old)     Units sold at the Adjusted Cost Base
U(new) = U(old) - u     You have u fewer units
ACB(new) = C(new)/U(new) = ACB(old)

After dividend for $d for u units
C(new) = C(old) - d*u
U(new) = U(old)
ACB(new) = C(new)/U(new)

Capital Gain = Proceeds of Sale - u ACB(old)
where Proceeds of Sale is after redemption fees, etc. have been deducted.
